A custom Wordpress theme and site for Media and Social engagement company 'GenWhy'

## Project description

This Project was built by a team of 3 front-end developers in conjunction with a team of UX designers.  The site includes multiple custom post types. We set up These custom post types to allow for optimal client content management. By doing this, the client can add images, descriptions, viedos (by pasting link into Wissey Wig editor), and other content to the 'events', 'projects', 'event clips', and 'short videos' post types. multiple custom fields were also added to the post types to allow for easier content management.

## Reflections 

Working as a team on our first client project was a great experience.  Our team worked well together, especially when it came to helping eachother with obstacles and any help that was needed.  This was also great practice for working with Wordpress and PHP, as well as for keeping our HTML, SASS, and JAVASCRIPT skills sharp. We worked with an amazing team of UX designers who were very easy to communicate with, were very approachable, and also very easy to work with. For a first real world project under a short time frame, this experience went over smooothly, and was quite enjoyable!
